# Data Description
The two datasets I am using to answer the research question and create a new dataset are the isotope ratios of d18O and d2H in precipitation (1) and streamflow (2). There are 4 datasets, and they are in csv formats. There is the precipitation isotope ratio dataset (1), and the amount of precipitation (2), the streamflow isotope ratios (3), and the streamflow amount (4). The datasets are formatted the same and are daily with around 32 stations per dataset where they begin in 2014 but most continuous data begins in 2016 an goes until 2022. This data is all physical data collected at each site. Isotope data is collected and sent to a lab to get tested for each isotope concentration as well as potential error with the data. I did not participate in the process of collecting and manipulating the precipitation dataset.  

This data will be used with the site characteristics (catchment, location, stream length, etc.) to develop complex mathematical equations to find how long the water resides in each system. These mathematical equations are based on existing research methods. I am currently in the process of calculating water residence times. 

# Roles and responsibilities
My advisor (Stephen Good) and I are the two working on this project. I am responsible for the DMP because it is my research that I am completing with help from my advisor. It is both my advisor and I responsibility to communicate with each other about the procedures with our DMP and the research itself to make sure our dataset is built correctly. 

If my advisor or I left this project, I think it would end. I do not have the experience with this research to continue it on my own and if my advisor left, my funding would leave, and I would probably work on new research with someone else. This is a discussion I should have with my advisor. 

# Data standards and metadata
During this project, the data will be stored on a seperate GIT repository that my advisor and I use to share our code and the datasets we are using. I have a seperate ReadMe file(s) that explain the procedures I am using to create these datsets. 

# Storage and security
The data I am working with is unrestricted so there are no protections that need to take place. This data is publicly available from NEON. I am using their data to merge it into several files, then manipulate them using hydrological calculations. 
 
# Access and data sharing
The data will be stored on a website called HydroShare once the project is finished. HydroShare is an open-source data repository to store and manage hydrologic data whether you are a faculty member, researcher, student, or a professional. HydroShare, “provides functionality that can take your research to the next level of openness and reproducibility, enhance the trustworthiness of research findings, and increase the reusability of research outputs.” 

I have the data backed up on a personal hard drive as well.

# Archiving and preservation
I have extra a copies of the dataset on my hard drive. The raw data is from the NEON and be retrieved at any time with code on GIT. I have created an all in one dataset to easily access this raw dataset from NEON. I have used code (R and python) to gather the NEON data into one csv file per data product. I plan to submit my code as well as a ReadMe file for others to recreate the data. This code makes the process automatic and easy to update as new data is collected over time.
