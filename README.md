Data Management Plan for the research project calculating observed water residence times with stable isotopes

Context of the project:
My research question is finding water residence time distributions using isotope data (d18O and d2H) from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). There is naturally occurring isotopes in water of d18O and d2H. These ratios allow for the tracking (isotope tracer) of when water hits a given area (Point A) as precipitation. The time it takes to reach Point B in the streamflow to have the same d18O and d2H ratio is the water residence time or how long water resides in each area. Water residence times vary in time and space per season, which is why transit time distributions (TTDs) can be used to characterize them at specific areas. The goal of my research is to develop TTDs across the NEON dataset, which has a station in every state in the US. The time water resides in an area has implications for water quality and management. If we have a better idea of how long water takes to move through a system, we can better prepare for climate change and maintain water resources. Throughout my dissertation, I hope to model TTDs and create various datasets manipulating the isotopes in precipitation and streamflow.
