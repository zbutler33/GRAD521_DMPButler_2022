Data Management Plan for the research project calculating observed water residence times with stable isotopes

Context of the project:
The two datasets I am using to answer the research question and create a new dataset are the isotope ratios of d18O and d2H in precipitation (1) and streamflow (2). There are 4 datasets, and they are in csv formats. There is the precipitation isotope ratio dataset (1), and the amount of precipitation (2), the streamflow isotope ratios (3), and the streamflow amount (4). The datasets are formatted the same and are daily with around 32 stations per dataset where they begin in 2014 but most continuous data begins in 2016 an goes until 2022. This data is all physical data collected at each site. Isotope data is collected and sent to a lab to get tested for each isotope concentration as well as potential error with the data. I did not participate in the process of collecting and manipulating the precipitation dataset.  

This data will be used with the site characteristics (catchment, location, stream length, etc.) to develop complex mathematical equations to find how long the water resides in each system. These mathematical equations are based on existing research methods. I am currently in the process of calculating water residence times.
